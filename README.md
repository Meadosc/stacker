## stacker


A prototype for a tool to generate Dockerfiles from templates and scripts for stacks. Be careful, there are rough edges!

### Things to note
- This tool is **NOT** a systems or language or even an application package manager for the use better tools that are areadly out there. (guix, mock, dpkg, pip, cargo, meson...)
- Reproducabile build setups can be (should be) used where possible for packages with exisiting tools like `Guix` or similar ones available.
- Rolling a halfassed package manager by your own would be a pain, *don't do it*.

This tool is just a glorified dockerfiles and singularity recipie sticher with additional support for linting, and possible building Docker (docker build) and Singularity Images.


### Project requirements

It is common to use pip and a virtual environment for python development. Consider using these tools while following this README. If you are using python 3 'venv' will already be installed, and all testing is done in python 3.

- [pip installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [virtual environment primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

Every python project has requirement files, in this case the repository
**stacker** has the following files:

- **requirements.txt**: which contains all the requirements
  that the project needs.


### Usage

- clone the github repo to your local

```
cd stacker/

```

- Install requirements

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

- Navigate to stacker.py

```
cd stacker
```

- Generate dockerfiles

```bash
python stacker.py --generate
```
This command will generate all possible dockerfiles for all OSes and frameworks
as defined in the spec file.

### Core components


- specs/dlrs.yaml

A loosely defined specification file

```yaml

---
version: "0.6.0"
description: "Deep Learning Reference Stack"
license: |
  # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  # Copyright (c) 2019 Intel Corporation

stack:
  dlrs:
    version: "0.6.0"
    tag: dlrs
    ubuntu:
      version: "18.10"
      tag: ubuntu
      os_pkgs:
        - openssh-server
        - openssh-client
        - wget
        - curl
        - python37
      python:

```
Similarly spec files for each stack can be defined, or even put into the one
single file.

- slices/component.dockerfile

Each component is defined as dockerfiles templates

Eg. A tensorflow dockerfile cane be something like:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install tensorflow=={{tf_version}}
```

Here `{{tf_version}}` is a variable that would be dynamically injected
from the spec file value `spec.stack.dlrs.ubuntu.tensorflow.version`

Another template is for the OS

```dockerfile
FROM {{os}}
RUN {{pkg_install}}  
```

Here, there are 2 placeholder variables `{{os}}` and `{{pkg_install}}`
Again, OS and system packages would be injected dynamically based on the spec
file

### Features

- parse spec file - DONE
- parse slices of dockerfiles per app - DONE
- update dockerfile based on the yaml file values - DONE
- enable elementary cli support - DONE

 **TODO**

- give option to build dockerimages from generated dockerfiles
- convert dockerfiles to singularity recepies
- lint dockerfiles
- resize images

### Core principles

- Maintainable and upgradable solution
- Use yaml specification files to define configuaration values
- Use Dockerfiles as templates which can accept substitution from the spec files
- Limit use of shell scripts/custom templates use Dockerfiles where possible
- Use official [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-py) and [Singularity](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-cli) clients where possible
